## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

For this project, I'm looking forward to getting substantial practice designing, writing, and implementing one of my ideas from scratch. This is something that I have wanted to gain more practice doing as a coder but havenâ€™t had the means to do so for a while. Every time I feel motivated to start a project of my own I either lose interest, and motivation or simply feel too busy to make it happen. The project aspect of this class is one of the main reasons I wanted to enroll in it in the first place. I am now looking forward to having no excuses to start a project of my own, knowing I will have the time blocked out to complete it along with the resources that this class will provide to push me through times I feel discouraged or stuck. 

To get into some of the specifics of what I want to get out of this project, I want to grow comfortable writing DSLs which I feel like I should be able to do as I plan on implementing two that will each serve a different purpose. This is important to me because I took this class with no prior knowledge of how DSLs worked or were created. To be able to pick up the ability to write them would feel like an accomplishment to me because it will remind me that I am capable of learning how to code things that I once thought were out of my ability. I hope that this project will motivate me to get out of my educational comfort zone more often.

Also, as I briefly touched on earlier, I want to gain comfort in creating my coding project from scratch, start to finish. My ultimate end goal for this project is to create something that I will use, and I would be super proud if I actually can make this happen. Creating functional projects like this is why I got into coding in the first place. Even if I don't create something fully functional and perfectly meets my desires, I look forward to gaining practice designing something of my own that this project is bound to deliver.


## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

A skill that we covered in this class that I would like to work on is implementing a DSL externally using packrat parsers. This was a tool that I found really cool when we went over it in class but I didn't choose to use it on the Picobot assignment. Since I struggled when trying to implement an internal DSL for the project, I would like to take a stab at writing an external DSL for this one and potentially use packrat parsing. Also, I currently think that my project will be better implemented as an external DSL which provided additional motivation for me to learn how to use this skill.

Something outside of this class that I would like the chance to work on would be to get the application side of my project up and running. So far through the HMC CS curriculum, I haven't gained very much experience writing projects that have a polished front-end result that the user can interact with. This is something that I have been interested in learning how to create but haven't gained any experience learning inside the classroom. So, I am really looking forward to connecting my DSLs to a front-end application that I can create and design. 

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

Before I go into a rough outline of a timeline I plan to follow for this project, I go over strategies I will use to maximize my productivity outside of the classroom. Having the ability to work in class is a great way to brainstorm with others and get help when stuck. I plan on using this resource to my advantage, but I will also make sure that my time spent working outside of class is equally productive. My main fear when working on my own is getting stuck and having all of my progress slowed to a halt. To avoid this, I plan on making my time spent in the classroom as useful as possible by creating a list of questions or topics I want to talk with others about before every class. 

I also know that for me to maximize my efficiency when working on this project I should thoroughly plan everything out so that I can foresee any roadblocks or challenges ahead of time. This will help me make sure that I am attacking my project in a way that allows me to achieve the greatest possible end result, and it also allows me to get an idea of what I need to do and how long everything will take me to complete.

Here's a rough outline of project milestones by week:

Week of 3/26: Create a detailed outline of the entire project including what libraries, tools, and files need to be used/created 

Week of 4/2: Write DSL #1, user --> icalendar

Week of 4/9: Write DSL #2, icalendar --> external app

Week of 4/16: Get external application running

Week of 4/23: Wrap up any loose ends

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

To help my project group to the best of my ability I will do the following things: make sure to block out sufficient time to review their project whenever needed, and actively engage with them in class. When giving feedback over GitHub, I want to make sure to read through and understand everything that their project includes which will allow me to give them helpful insight. I believe that this will require me to take the time to initially read through their entire project before going back and adding my comments. I want to make sure that I am as helpful as possible because I hope that they will hold the same standard for themselves when giving feedback to me. 

When we are in class, I also want to be as helpful as possible to my group members which I believe starts with actively listening to what they have to say. I want to be able to help them answer their questions, not just hear and think about them. For me to do this though, I will need to fully understand how their project works and ask questions when I am confused. I hope that my questions will point out areas that may not be clear to others that they want to improve. Additionally, by asking questions, I will understand their project on a deeper level which will hopefully allow me to help them to the best of my ability.

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

At the end of the semester, I will be very proud to show others my project if it is fully working and has replaced the old calendar system that I currently use. This would make me very proud as I chose this project topic to solve an issue in my life and I want to be able to use it when it is complete. Since the scope of my project is intended to help students like myself, I would be particularly pleased if other students also found it cool and wanted to use it too. 

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

A-: Something that immediately came to mind when considering A- work would be well-documented idea evolution. The odds that I stick to my original project plan without fail seems very slim to me, I can already see myself making unforeseen changes. Whether I come up with a new feature that I believe would make my DSLs more useful or I decide to abandon an idea because I realize it is outside the scope of this project, if these ideas are well documented it will make it clear to see what I got out of this project and how I grew as a coder. Also, I believe that A- level work shows consistent progress and effort regardless of the outcome. If this project takes me far longer than I anticipated and I don't make it near the final result, as long as I chipped away at the task at hand and moved forward, I showed that I did the best that I could.

A: I believe that A level work meets all of the requirements of A- level work but additionally clearly demonstrates that a good deal of time and effort was put into this project. This can be shown in a variety of ways including constant idea generation, solid weekly progress, help sought out during office hours, and anything that demonstrates consistent growth and learning. I think that if I meet all of the milestones that I outlined earlier and worked on the skills/concepts that I wanted to, my project would reach this grade.
