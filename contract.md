## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

A-: Something that immediately came to mind when considering A- work would be well documented idea evolution. The odds that I stick to my original project plan without fail seems verly slim to me, I can already see myself making unforseen changes. Whether I come up with a new feature that I belive would make my DSL more useful or I decide to abandon an idea because I realize it is outside the scope of this project, if these ideas are well documented it will make it clear to see what I got out of this project and how I grew as a coder.
