## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

For this project, I'm looking forward to getting substantial practice designing, writing and implementing one of my own ideas from scratch. This is something that I have wanted to gain more practice doing as a coder but havenâ€™t had the means to do so for a while. Everytime I feel motivated to start a project of my own I either lose interest, motivation, or simply feel too busy to actually make it happen. The project aspect of this class one of the main reasons I wanted to enroll in it in the first place. I am now looking forward to having no excuses to start a project of my own, knowing I will have the time blocked out to complete it along with the resources that this class will provide to push me through times I feel discoraged or stuck. 

To get into some of the specifics of what I want to get out of this project, I want to grow comfortable writing DSLs which I feel like I should be able to do as I plan on implemting two that will each serve a different pupose. This is important to me because I took this class with no proir knowlege of how DSLs worked or were created. To be able to pick up the ability to write them would feel like an acomplishment to me because it will remind me that I am capible of learning how to code things that I once thought were out of my ablilty. I hope that this project will motivate me to get out of my educational comfort zone more often.

Also, as I brefily touched on earlier, I want to gain comfort creating my own coding project from scratch, start to finish. My ultimate end goal for this project is to create something that I will acutally use, which I would be super proud if I actually can make this happen. Creating functional projects like this are why I got into coding in the first place. Even if I don't create something that is fully functional and perfectly meets my desires, I look forward to gaining practice designing something of my own that this project is bound to deliver.


## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

An skill that we covered in this class that I would like to work on is implementing a DSL externally using packrat parsers. This was a tool that I found really cool when we went over it in class but I didn't choose to use it on the Picobot assignment. Since I struggled trying to implement an internal DSL for the project, I would like to take a stab at writing an external DSL for this one and potentially use packrat parsing. Also, I currenlty think that my project will be better implemented as an external DSL which provided additional motivation for me to learn how to use this skill.

Something ouside of this class that I would like the chance to work on would be to get the application side of my project up and running. So far through the HMC CS ciriculum, I havent gained very much experience writing projects that have a polished front end result that the user can interact with. This is something that I have been interested in learning how to create but haven't gained any experience learning inside the classroom. So, I am really looking forward to connecting my DSLs to a front end appication that I can create and design. 

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_


## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

A-: Something that immediately came to mind when considering A- work would be well documented idea evolution. The odds that I stick to my original project plan without fail seems verly slim to me, I can already see myself making unforseen changes. Whether I come up with a new feature that I belive would make my DSL more useful or I decide to abandon an idea because I realize it is outside the scope of this project, if these ideas are well documented it will make it clear to see what I got out of this project and how I grew as a coder.
