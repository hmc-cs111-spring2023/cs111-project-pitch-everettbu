# Project proposal

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

This project will serve people who create digital monthly calanders and want make them more easily. My motivation to take on this project stems from the idea of professors and students being using my DSL together. I imagine professors giving a text file that contains all important due dates for their class to their students written in my language. Since the text file will be written in my language, it can then be able to be passed through an application that reads the file and adds the items to a calander. This would allow for students to easily create a visual represnetation for all assignments that they have due over the course of the semester, instead of having to create their own manually or refering to a calender created by the professor on the class website or syllabus.  

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

My idea will meet the needs of students and anyone who creates a digital calender on their computer. As a student, at the beggining of each semester I go through the syllabuses for each of my classes and create a calaender that contains due dates for all of my upcoming assignments. Since I learn and remember things visually, I like to create a monthly where I can see everything at once. Thus far, I have manually created a calender in excel for each semester I have been in college. This process takes upwards of two hours which involves setting the dates for each school week, scraping each syllabus for assignment due dates,  determining what is worthy of putting on my calender (some professors make this easier/more clear than others as they clearly outline what is due on their syllabus), and color coding assignments by class. 
  
If I am able to help myself, and others who face this problem, one would be able to create a long-term calander by first intilatilizing a desired length for their calender and then by passing in a file with items they want to add. What makes my DSL unique and helpful is that it will allow users to easily  add details when inputing their items instead of altering them manually afterwards. These include:
  - Reoccurance: The user can specify if they want the item to reoccur my week, month, etc.
  - Color: the user can easily manipulate the color of the item by specifying it in the input
  - Bold/underline/italicizate
I will likely write two DSLs: one that handles entering events, and another that works with the look and feel of the program


### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

Since my domain is limited to creating a calander, a DSL is appropriate as it will allow for me to create a language of text inputs that can be translated into a visual output of a calender. This will be a great oppertunity for me to practice writing a DSL as I will need to determine how I want inputs to be structured and what types of parameters the inputs can include. Its addresses the need because it will allow for users to create a calender based off text input which will hopefully save many people time. My DSL will hopefully serve as a useful tool to automate the tedious process of creating an online calender one element at a time. The domain is niche yet widely used which is why I belive that a DSL is approprate and needed.

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I'm excited by this idea because it is something that I would actually use and I know other people who would benefit from it too. I came up with the idea after interviewing a CMC environmental science major, who told me about how they really rely on their computer for scheduling their work. After thinking about what they said, I thought about how I interact with my computer in the same way and realized that I had a few pain points in this area. Currently, as a Google calender user, I have to manually input each event into the calender which can become tedious when I have multiple similar events (study times) to enter at once. Also, Google calender doesnt have a great full month view which I like to use. I am excited to potenitally create a solution to these pain points as I will actually use my project if it is built well. I find it extremely motivating to work on something that I will actually use. 

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Easy full semester time management

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_
